This is my personal portfolio project, developed using [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter "Flutter"). It began as a simple personal challenge and a way to apply the skills I've acquired in app development using [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter "Flutter"). The concept of the project is inspired by emulating a mobile phone, complete with a lock screen and a home screen containing functional apps. These apps provide information about me, my education, my skills, my CV, my social media profiles, and more.


## Features

- Emulates a mobile phone with a lock screen and home screen.
- Provides detailed information about me, my educational background, and my professional skills.
- Offers access to my CV (resume) for download.
- Links to my social media profiles for easy networking.
- Send emails directly from the email app on the home screen.
- Make calls to my personal number using the phone app.
- Launch the camera app
- A functional weather widget to display current weather conditions.
- A music widget (currently under development) for playing music.

## Project Status
This project is currently in active development, and I have exciting plans for its future. I aim to add more widgets to the home screen, providing additional functionality and enhancing the user experience. One of the key improvements I plan to make is to ensure that the lock screen time updates dynamically to reflect the current time.
